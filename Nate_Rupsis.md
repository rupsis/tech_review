#  Introduction 

<!-- Over the course of n year, we've seen an exponetial growth in data creation, etc (cite resource) -->

Over the course of past several decades, we've seen an exponential growth of data creation, dissemination, and availability. According to Statista.com [1] the volume of data created world wide has increased 30 fold since 2010, and is forecasted to triple over the next 4 years. Because of this, we have more information at our fingertips then ever before. However, too much of a good thing can lead to some unintended consequences. This paper will briefly summarize some areas of research which aims to help the educational efforts to provides highly relevant, useful, and summarized information for learning. 

## Body

<!-- With the rise of choice, it becomes more difficult to find highly relivant information -->


<!-- Tie this into education  -->

Because of this, we're facing issues of increased search time, less relivancy, and information fatiuge. 

<!-- how we're starting to use big data tools to start consolidating information for education and learning -->

To combate this, various research has been done within the education fields to try and provided high relivant, and availble information (primarily, or secondary)

This paper will briefly summerize some areas of research to help aid in the eductational efforts to provides students with relivant summerized information.











<!-- Reference sites, blog posts, etc.  While learning has become easier, it's also become more separated.  -->

<!-- Cite methods of how it's used -->

<!-- Tools to provides relivant information, AXIS, Tutorons -->

<!-- How community efforts are helping aid in the educational efforts (DynamicSlide) -->



## Conclusion

<!-- With the ever increasing amount of information being created, it's important to be able to provide highly avaible, relevant data to promote and drive education behaviors -->
